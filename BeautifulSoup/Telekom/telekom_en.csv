Telemedicine,NST,"Telemedicine is a subdiscipline of telematics in the healthcare sector. It refers to diagnostics and treatment that uses telecommunications to overcome a spatial or temporal separation between physician, pharmacist, and patient, or between two consulting physicians."
TeraStream,NST,"TeraStream is a new cloud-based IP network architecture. It helps substantially reduce IT complexity in existing networks by migrating the operating systems for network operation to the cloud. Network administration and management becomes much easier by using the cloud model since these functions are provided centrally from a single data center rather than directly on the respective network component, as previously."
TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio),NST,"This originally stood for ""Trans-European Trunk Radio"".TETRA is a standard for digital trunked radio. Because of its special service features, it is particularly suitable for government agencies and organizations that fulfill security tasks (police, fire brigade, rescue services)."
